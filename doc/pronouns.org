*** Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns may be used on their own but are also incorporated frequently
into verbal inflection. They have the following characteristics:

  * First/second/third person designations.
  * Subject/object designations. Formally the subject form is the nominative
    case, while the object form covers the oblique case, a.k.a. "everything
    else". (This is the same casing system English uses.)
  * Singular/dual/plural designations. The dual number refers specifically to
    two of a thing; thus separate pronouns are used to refer to "you, alone",
    "the two of you", and "y'all".
  * No gender or sentience distinctions, including for third person personals.
    That is, the same word is used for he, she, and it.

|          | Singular | Dual      | Plural        |
|          | (~-S/-O~)  | (~-dS/-dO~) | (~-pS/-pO~)     |
|----------+----------+-----------+---------------|
| 1P (~1-~)  | wm / um  | wn / un   | wy / uy       |
| 2P (~2-~)  | iz / ez  | ij / ej   | ix / ex       |
| 3P (~3-~)  | at / ot  | ab / ob   | ad / od       |
| REL (~R-~) | al / ol  | an / on   | ary(u)/ory(u) |

Relative pronouns are only used in [[file:subclauses.org][dependent clauses]]. Note that when the
relative plurals appear on their own they are written ~aryu~ and ~oryu~ to comply
with correct syllable formation; however, when they are infixed, they are simply
~-ary-~ and ~-ory-~.

For purposes of memorization, note that all the pronouns are a vowel and a
consonant. (This is the main exception to the rule that noun-like things end in
vowels.) Furthermore the vowel does not depend at all on the number, and the
consonant does not depend at all on the case.

The possessive form of personal pronouns is formed by infixing the subject form
of the pronoun into ~r*o~.

|         | Singular (~-G~) | Dual (~-dG~) | Plural (~-pG~) |
|---------+---------------+------------+--------------|
| 1P (~1-~) | rwmo          | rwno       | rwyo         |
| 2P (~2-~) | rizo          | rijo       | rixo         |
| 3P (~3-~) | rato          | rabo       | rado         |

Note that the choice of infixed pronoun indicates the number of /possessors/, and
standard [[file:nouns.org#number][pluralization]] still applies to indicate the number of /possessed items/.
In addition, each word functions equally as both noun and adjective; for
example, ~rwmo~ is used for both "my" and "mine" and disambiguation is up to the
listener.

This possessive infixing pattern is used for some, but not all, other pronouns,
where explicitly noted below.

*** Determinatives and Demonstratives

"This" and "that" are demonstrative pronouns that differ from regular nouns
primarily in that they have special handling for their objective and possessive
cases that regular nouns don't. They are otherwise handled like regular nouns,
and in particular pluralized like them. These rules will be discussed later; for
now, the following table should suffice:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
|      | Singular  | Dual      | Plural      |
|------+-----------+-----------+-------------|
| This | ita / eta | itw / etw | itwe / etwe |
| That | iqa / eqa | iqw / eqw | iqwe / eqwe |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Like most Perflontus nouns (again, to be covered more thoroughly later), ~ita~ et
al. may also be used as demonstrative adjectives.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Demiunu  etwe       torelwe  et   wlatoc.
Damien   these-OBJ  cookies  FUT  eat-3S.
Damien will eat these cookies.

Demiunu  etwe       et   wlatoc.
Damien   these-OBJ  FUT  eat-3S.
Damien will eat these.

Ita       somatotun.
This-SUB  please-3S-3O.
This pleases him.
#+END_EXAMPLE

There is no direct equivalent for the definite article "the". Depending on the
context it is correct to either omit any qualifier at all or to use "this" or
"that" as appropriate instead.

Similarly there is no directly equivalent to the indefinite article "a(n)". When
it is necessary to refer to some indefinite item ~ke~ (literally "one") is used
instead.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Tusvo  yipox  et   capatil.
Bus    soon   FUT  arrive-3S.
(The) bus will arrive soon.

Ke   tusvo  yipox  et   capatil.
One  bus    soon   FUT  arrive-3S.
A bus will arrive soon.

Iqa   ke   tusvo  yipox  et   capatil.
That  one  bus    soon   FUT  arrive-3S.
The 1 bus will arrive soon.

***** Notes

  * ~Axwe~ "every" is always plural in Perflontus; there is not singular
    inflection. It also imposes the plural inflection on anything in modifies.
    This is counter to many languages where "every" is frequently singular, e.g.
    "everything", "cada vez", "tout".
  * For similar reasons the same is true of all the quantity forms.
  * The "this" and "that" forms of most things do not take a subject/object
    inflection.
  * The various forms referring to place, time, way, and reason are
    systematically formed from their nouns, but also drop the final vowel in
    their converstion to adverbs.
  * ~tizov~ "this-way" and ~tidul~ "this-reason" are both reasonably glossed as
    "if", but ~tizov~ is used in cases where the if-clause indicates a mechanical
    cause for something, whereas ~tidul~ indicates more abstract causality.
    Another way to put it, which also applies to ~alzov~ and ~aldul~ in the opposite
    direction, is that ~*zov~ clauses are answers to questions better phrased as
    "how", while ~*dul~ clauses are answers to questions better phrased as "why".
    A fuller treatment of these particular words is in [[file:clauses.org#causation-and-intent---how-why][Causation and Intent Clauses]].
